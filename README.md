# Tietorakenteet ja algoritmit -kurssin projekti
# Data Structures and Algorithms -course project

This repository contains the source code of the two projects written for the Datastructures and Algorithms -course in autumn 2021. The most relevant part --and the only code files written by me-- are the datastructures.hh and datastructures.cc -files in both project directories. On top of that, in the directories there are test text files and source code files building the program and the GUI. These files are provided by the course instructors.

Furthermore, test_info.md file provided by the course staff explains the purpose of the different test files. Also in both project directories there are separate README.md -files written by me describing the decisions and the idea of the program.
